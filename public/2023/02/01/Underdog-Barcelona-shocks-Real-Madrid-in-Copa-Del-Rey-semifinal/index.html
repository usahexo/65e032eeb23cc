<p>The semifinal matchup of the Copa Del Rey between Barcelona and Real Madrid was highly anticipated. The two clubs are elite members of La Liga, and usually battle it out for the top spot. This season, they are battling for 2nd place behind surprise contenders Atletico Madrid. With both clubs needing a morale boost after disappointing league campaigns, this matchup held a lot of weight. Unfortunately for Real Madrid, they were not able to get the win at home and suffered a humiliating 3-1 loss to Barcelona.</p>
<p>This fixture always has a lot of emotion involved given the intense rivalry between the two teams. Madrid came out firing in an attempt to take an early lead and quiet the raucous Camp Nou crowd. However, centre back Gerard Pique was able to get his head on a corner kick from Neymar in the 10th minute and give Barcelona the lead. It only got worse for Madrid from there, as Neymar added another goal in the 26th minute with some nifty footwork in front of Keylor Navas. Things went from bad to worse for Los Blancos when Sergio Ramos was shown a straight red card for a dangerous challenge on Neymar in the 44th minute.</p>
<p>With their backs against the wall, Madrid made a few changes at halftime in an attempt to salvage something from the match. This included bringing on Isco and Alvaro Morata in place of Luka Modric and Karim Benzema. They were also forced to play with 10 men for over an hour, which is always difficult against Barcelona. Even with the numerical disadvantage, they were still able to pull one back through Marco Asensio late in the match. However, it was not enough as Barcelona held on for the win.</p>
<p>This result means that Barca advances to their first Copa Del Rey final since 2014-15 season, where they lost to Atletico Madrid. They will now face either Sevilla or Celta Vigo in what should be an exciting finale at Santiago Bernabeu stadium next month. As for Real Madrid, this latest defeat will only add more pressure on manager Zinedine Zidane heading into next season.</p>
<h1 id="Barcelona-scores-late-to-stun-Juventus-in-Champions-League"><a href="#Barcelona-scores-late-to-stun-Juventus-in-Champions-League" class="headerlink" title="Barcelona scores late to stun Juventus in Champions League"></a>Barcelona scores late to stun Juventus in Champions League</h1><p>What a comeback by Barcelona! Trailing 3-0 from the first leg of their Champions League quarterfinal tie against Juventus, the Catalans looked all but out of the competition, but they staged a stunning late fightback to win 3-0 and progress to the semi-finals.</p>
<p>Lionel Messi led the way with a brilliant brace, while Neymar also got on the scoresheet as Barca produced an unforgettable performance. Juve had looked in complete control for most of the match, but they were eventually undone by one of the all-time great European Cup performances.</p>
<p>The result means that Barcelona are now one step away from becoming the first team ever to retain their Champions League crown, and they will face either Atletico Madrid or Real Madrid in the last four. For Juventus, it is yet another crushing disappointment in Europe’s premier club competition – and it is difficult to see them recovering from this latest setback.</p>
<h1 id="Valverde’s-under-small-tactics-pay-off-as-Barca-ousts-Sevilla-from-Copa-Cup"><a href="#Valverde’s-under-small-tactics-pay-off-as-Barca-ousts-Sevilla-from-Copa-Cup" class="headerlink" title="Valverde’s under small tactics pay off as Barca ousts Sevilla from Copa Cup"></a>Valverde’s under small tactics pay off as Barca ousts Sevilla from Copa Cup</h1><p>In the end, it was a textbook victory from Barcelona. The Blaugrana controlled the possession and tempo of the match, and although Sevilla posed a threat on counters, they were ultimately dispatched with aplomb.</p>
<p>Much of the credit for this must go to manager Ernesto Valverde, who deployed an interesting tactical plan which saw him start with three defensive midfielders - Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic and Philippe Coutinho. This stifled Sevilla’s attacks in the early stages, and even led to them taking the lead courtesy of a Pablo Sarabia goal.</p>
<p>But Valverde’s ploy proved to be a masterstroke, as Barcelona eventually took control of the game and scored twice in quick succession through Gerard Pique and Luis Suarez. They could have had more too, but were denied by some excellent goalkeeping by Tomas Vaclik.</p>
<p>It was a great result for Barcelona, who will now move on to face Valencia in the final of the Copa del Rey. And they’ll do so with Valverde having once again shown that he is capable of getting the best out of this talented squad - even when he doesn’t have all his star players at his disposal.</p>
<h1 id="Messi-amp-company-continue-underdog-run-with-victory-over-Chelsea-in-UCL"><a href="#Messi-amp-company-continue-underdog-run-with-victory-over-Chelsea-in-UCL" class="headerlink" title="Messi &amp; company continue underdog run with victory over Chelsea in UCL"></a>Messi &amp; company continue underdog run with victory over Chelsea in UCL</h1><p>In the wake of Barcelona’s semifinal victory over Chelsea on Wednesday, many have already written off the English side as a lost cause. And why not? After all, Lionel Messi and his fellow superstars looked every bit the part of EPL stalwarts in dismantling the Blues 3-0 on aggregate.</p>
<p>And yet, this Barcelona side is not your typical powerhouse. They are, for all intents and purposes, an underdog – one that continues to defy expectations time and time again.</p>
<p>This season has been no different. Heading into the Champions League semifinal matchup against Chelsea, Barcelona were seen as heavy underdogs. Most pundits picked Antonio Conte’s side to come out on top, with many expecting Messi and company to crash out at the semifinal stage yet again.</p>
<p>However, Barcelona proved the doubters wrong by securing a 3-0 victory on aggregate – capped off by Wednesday night’s impressive 2-0 win at Stamford Bridge. This was a timely statement from the Catalan club, who will now look to lift their third Champions League trophy in four years when they take on Juventus in next month’s final.</p>
<p>While it would be foolish to write off Chelsea given their impressive performances in the Premier League this season, it is hard not to give Barcelona the edge heading into next month’s showdown in Cardiff. With Messi in unstoppable form and Neymar starting to hit his stride once again, Luis Enrique’s side will be confident of avenging their 2015 UCL final defeat to Juventus.</p>
<h1 id="Late-game-magic-propels-Barcelona-past-Lyon-into-Champions-League-semifinals"><a href="#Late-game-magic-propels-Barcelona-past-Lyon-into-Champions-League-semifinals" class="headerlink" title="Late-game magic propels Barcelona past Lyon, into Champions League semifinals"></a>Late-game magic propels Barcelona past Lyon, into Champions League semifinals</h1><p>Down a goal on aggregate and down to 10 men, Barcelona’s Lionel Messi scored two goals in the final 15 minutes of regulation plus stoppage time to send his side through to the Champions League semifinals with a 4-1 win over Lyon on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Messi’s first goal, in the 78th minute, was Barca’s first shot on target all night and started a dramatic comeback. The Argentinian struck again in the second minute of stoppage time, completing Barcelona’s rally and earning the team its place in the semifinal draw.</p>
<p>“What Leo did is not normal,” teammate Philippe Coutinho said of Messi’s performance. “He always makes history.”</p>
<p>Barca will face Liverpool in the semifinal. The Reds advanced by shocking Premier League champion Manchester City 5-1 on aggregate earlier Wednesday. It will be the third meeting between Liverpool and Barcelona in the Champions League; Liverpool won both previous meetings, most recently in 2007.</p>
<p>Barca looked headed for an early exit when Lyon’s Lucas Tousart scored in the first leg last week to give Les Gones a 1-0 advantage heading into Wednesday’s match at Camp Nou Stadium. But Coutinho equalized midway through the second half Wednesday, setting up Messi’s heroics.</p>
<p>Messi now has 108 goals in Champions League competition, one shy of Cristiano Ronaldo’s record 109. He also has moved past previous record-holder Rivaldo as Barcelona’s all-time Champions League scoring leader with 45 goals.</p>
