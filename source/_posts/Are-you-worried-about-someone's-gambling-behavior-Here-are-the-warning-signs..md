#  Warning signs that your loved one may have a gambling problem.

Gambling can be an enjoyable, social activity for some people. However, for others, it can become an addiction that ruins lives. If you are worried that your loved one may have a gambling problem, look out for the warning signs listed below.

1. Your loved one gambles more than they can afford to lose.

One of the key signs of a gambling addiction is when someone starts to gamble more than they can afford to lose. They may start to gamble away their rent money or even money set aside for bills and groceries.

2. Your loved one lies about their gambling habits.

People with gambling addictions often try to hide their habit from others. If your loved one is constantly lying about where they’ve been or what they’ve been doing, it’s possible that they’re hiding a gambling addiction.

3. Your loved one becomes aggressive or agitated when questioned about their gambling habit.

When someone is trying to hide something, they often become defensive and agitated when questioned about it. If your loved one gets angry or hostile when you ask them about their gambling habit, it’s likely that there is something going on that they don’t want you to know about.

4. Your loved one has developed financial problems as a result of their gambling habit.

If your loved one has started to rack up debts as a result of their gambling addiction, this is definitely cause for concern. Financial problems are often one of the first signs that someone has a problem with gambling.

5. Your loved one has lost interest in other activities and hobbies that they used to enjoy.

Gamblers often start to withdraw from activities and hobbies that used to make them happy in order to focus more on their addiction. If your loved one has stopped enjoying things that used to make them happy, it could be because of their involvement in gambling.
