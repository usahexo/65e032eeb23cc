#  Bucks take down Celtics to take control of series

Down 2-1 in their playoff series against the Celtics, the Bucks looked to take control of things in Game 4. And they did just that, cruising to a 116-91 victory to take a 3-1 lead in the series.

Giannis Antetokounmpo led the way for Milwaukee, scoring 26 points on 12-of-17 shooting. Khris Middleton added 21 points, 8 rebounds, and 7 assists, while Eric Bledsoe chipped in 20 points and 7 assists.

Boston was led by Jayson Tatum's 23 points. Kyrie Irving added 16 points and 8 assists, but no other Celtics player scored more than 10 points.

The Bucks now have a chance to close out the series at home in Game 5 on Wednesday night.

In what was a close matchup throughout, the Giannis Antetokounmpo-led Bucks managed to pull away in the fourth quarter and win 109-105, taking a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series.

Antetokounmpo finished with 28 points, 12 rebounds and 7 assists, while Khris Middleton scored 30 points.

“We just had to stick together,” Antetokounmpo said afterwards. “They were making shots, we were making shots. We just had to stay together, play defense and make plays for each other on offense.”

Eric Bledsoe came off the bench to score 14 points for Milwaukee, while George Hill put up 17 points for the Pacers.

Victor Oladipo, who averaged over 27 points per game during the regular season, was held to just 15 points on 5-of-19 shooting.

Game 4 is scheduled for Sunday in Indianapolis.

#  Milwaukee Bucks surge ahead in Eastern Conference Finals

In the first two games of the Eastern Conference Finals, the Milwaukee Bucks have outscored the Toronto Raptors by a combined total of 38 points. Led by MVP candidate Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee is looking like the favorite to come out of the East and reach their first NBA Finals in franchise history.

The Bucks have been clicking on all cylinders offensively, averaging 116.5 points per game in these first two contests. They are shooting an impressive 50.6 percent from the field, and 41 percent from beyond the arc.

Giannis has been a force to be reckoned with, averaging 27 points, 12 rebounds and six assists per game. Khris Middleton has also been playing extremely well, averaging 24 points and seven rebounds per game. Malcolm Brogdon has also contributed off the bench, averaging 10 points and four assists per game.

The Raptors were expected to give the Bucks a challenge in this series, but they have looked overmatched so far. Kawhi Leonard has been the only player who has been able to score at a consistent rate for Toronto, averaging 28 points per game. Marc Gasol has been struggles offensively, averaging just nine points per game on 33 percent shooting from the field.

If the Bucks can continue to play at this level, they should be able to easily win this series and make it to their first NBA Finals in franchise history.

#  Playoff experience pays off for Milwaukee Bucks

After a grueling seven-game series with the Boston Celtics, the Milwaukee Bucks emerged victorious and punched their ticket to the Eastern Conference Finals. Led by MVP candidate Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Bucks will now face off against the Toronto Raptors for a chance to play in the NBA Finals.

While Giannis has been the focal point of the Bucks offence, he has not had to do it all alone. Khris Middleton and Eric Bledsoe have both stepped up in a big way during the playoffs, averaging 16.8 and 17.1 points per game respectively. Brook Lopez has also been a force in the paint, averaging 12.5 points and 7 rebounds per game.

The Raptors have had a relatively easy run to the Eastern Conference Finals, sweeping both the Orlando Magic and Philadelphia 76ers. Kawhi Leonard has been his usual dominant self, averaging 31 points and 9 rebounds per game in those two series. Pascal Siakam has also been impressive, averaging 18 points and 7 rebounds per game.

Despite being underdogs against the Raptors, the Bucks have plenty of reasons to be confident. They have already proven they can beat Toronto this season, winning all four matchups between the two teams. The Bucks are also one of just two teams (along with the Golden State Warriors) that have made it to the Conference Finals in both of the last two seasons.

With so much on the line, this series is sure to be an exciting one. The Bucks will need everyone on their roster to step up if they want to hoist their first NBA Championship banner since 1971.

#  Milwaukee Bucks eye NBA Championship with win over Celtics

The Milwaukee Bucks have their eyes on the prize as they defeated the Boston Celtics to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals. Giannis Antetokounmpo was the engine that drove the Bucks, scoring 22 points and grabbing 14 rebounds in the victory. The Celtics made a game of it, but Milwaukee's defense was too much for them, holding them to just 88 points.

Boston is a good team, but they certainly don't matchup well against Milwaukee. The Celtics are too reliant on scoring from their stars, Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward. When those two are held in check, as was the case in Game 5, Boston struggles offensively. Meanwhile, the Bucks have multiple players who can score at will, led by Giannis Antetokounmpo.

Milwaukee's defense was also impressive in this series. They held Boston to just 42 percent shooting from the field and averaged 12.8 turnovers per game. That type of defensive pressure will be needed against teams like Toronto and Philadelphia if they want to win the NBA Championship.

The Bucks are now one step away from reaching their first NBA Finals since 1974. They'll face either Philadelphia or Toronto in the Eastern Conference Finals. These teams both pose a serious threat to Milwaukee, but with Giannis Antetokounmpo leading the charge, anything is possible.
