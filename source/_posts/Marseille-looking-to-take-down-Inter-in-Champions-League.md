The Ligue 1 side Marseille will be looking to take down Serie A side Inter Milan in the Champions League when they meet on Wednesday. This is a matchup that could go either way, as both teams are evenly matched.

#  Olympique De Marseille looking to upset Inter and advance in Champions League

After a 3-0 home loss in the first leg, Olympique De Marseille has a daunting task Tuesday trying to overturn a three-goal deficit when it visits Inter Milan in the Champions League.

The Serie A side is unbeaten in its past 10 games and should be confident of advancing after midfielder Radja Nainggolan's brace and Marcelo Brozovic's goal gave them such a commanding lead. However, Marseille is no slouch, as it currently sits second in Ligue 1, just two points behind Paris Saint-Germain.

Goalkeeper Steve Mandanda will be looking to keep a clean sheet after conceding three goals against his former club in the first leg, while striker Dimitri Payet will be looking to make an impact after scoring 10 goals in all competitions this season.

Inter Milan manager Luciano Spalletti knows that his side will have to be at its best to advance to the next round, but is confident that they can get the job done. "In order to win you have to score four goals," Spalletti said after the first leg. "But we're not going there just to defend."
