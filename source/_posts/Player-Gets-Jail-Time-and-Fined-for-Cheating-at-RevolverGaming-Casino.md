A casino employee has been arrested after being caught helping players cheat at [RevolverGaming Casino](https://www.primecasinobonuses.com/revolvergaming-casino/).

The employee, who has not been named, is accused of allowing players to use software that helped them to see the slot machines’ RNG results ahead of time. This gave them an advantage over other players, as they were able to make better decisions about when to place their bets.

The casino has released a statement confirming the arrest, and also noting that it has taken steps to improve its security in order to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

This is not the first time that a casino employee has been caught helping players cheat; in fact, it’s becoming an increasingly common problem. Just last year, employees at two different casinos were caught assisting players in cheating at blackjack and roulette respectively.

It’s important to remember that casinos have a number of ways of detecting cheating, so if you’re thinking of trying to take advantage of them, you’re likely to get caught. In addition, casinos can (and often do) terminate the employment of any employee found guilty of cheating. So if you’re thinking of cheating at a casino, be prepared to lose your job – and your reputation!

#  How to Avoid Getting Caught Cheating at RevolverGaming Casino

If you're looking to game at RevolverGaming Casino and avoid getting caught, you're in luck. Just follow these simple tips and you'll be on your way to a successful gaming session:

Tip #1: Stick to Probability Games

The first thing you'll want to do is stick to games that have a lower house edge. This will minimize the chances of being caught cheating as the casino will be less likely to suspect foul play. Probability games like blackjack, roulette, and baccarat are the best choices for this.

Tip #2: Use Low-Stake Games

Another way to reduce the chances of getting caught is by playing low stakes games. This will make it look like you're not trying to win big and are just there for some casual fun. It's also important to keep your betting patterns consistent so that the casino doesn't become suspicious.

Tip #3: Don't Play Too Long

It's also a good idea not to play too long at any one sitting. This will help make it look like you're not trying to make too much money from the casino. If you're only playing for an hour or two then it won't seem out of the ordinary if you happen to lose a bit of money.

Tip #4: Use Multiple Accounts

If you're looking to make some serious profits from RevolverGaming Casino, then using multiple accounts can be a wise move. By using multiple accounts, you can spread your bets out over different games and increase your chances of winning big. Just be sure to keep track of what bets are associated with which account so that there's no confusion later on.
