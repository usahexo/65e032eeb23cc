#  What is Burning Classics?

Burning Classics is an annual book-burning event that takes place on the University of Utah campus. The event is organized by a student group known as the "Campus Conservatives."

The goal of Burning Classics is to "destroy and burn any and all books that do not meet our conservative values." This includes books from authors such as Maxine Hong Kingston, Toni Morrison, and Maya Angelou.

The event has been met with criticism from many students and faculty members at the University of Utah. Some argue that Burning Classics is an act of censorship, while others argue that it represents a violation of free speech rights.

#  What is the Burning Classics Game?

The Burning Classics Game is a card game where players are tasked with completing a book by burning certain cards in order. The game can be played with 3-8 players, and takes about an hour to play.

To begin, each player is dealt 7 cards. The player with the highest rank card begins the game and play passes clockwise. On a player’s turn they draw one card from the deck and play one. There are five different types of cards in the deck- nouns, verbs, conjunctions, articles, and punctuation.

Nouns are simply cards that represent objects or people. Verbs represent action words, while conjunctions are linking words like and or but. Articles are either a or an while punctuation marks are things like commas or question marks.

The goal of the game is to create a sentence with the cards in your hand. Nouns must be used as the Subject of the sentence and verbs must be used as the Action verb. You can also use any number of articles and conjunctions to make your sentence as long as you want, but you can only use each word once. For example, my cat sat on the mat could become My little cat frustratingly sat on top of that mat again.

Once you have created a sentence, you must burn one card from your hand to represent it being put into action. If at any time you cannot create a sentence with the cards in your hand, you must pick up another card from the deck and add it to your hand. The first player to lose all their cards wins the game!

#  Why is Burning Classics so popular?

For years, the burning of books has been seen as a form of censorship. Protesters have gathered to defend the right to read and think freely. But in the last decade, a new type of book burning has emerged: the burning of classics.

What could motivate someone to burn a book that’s considered a literary masterpiece? The answer is complicated. For some, burning classics is a way to express their anger at the author or the institution that assigned the book. Others see it as a way to challenge conventional thinking or spark conversation about controversial topics.

Whatever the reason, there’s no doubt that burning classics is becoming increasingly popular. In fact, there are now dozens of websites and social media pages devoted to it. And each year, more and more books are burned around the world.

So why is this trend growing? There are probably many reasons, but here are three possible explanations:

1) People are looking for new ways to express their views and stand out from the crowd.
2) They want to provoke discussion about controversial topics.
3) They believe that these books are no longer relevant or useful.

Regardless of the reasons, it’s clear that burning classics is here to stay. So what does this mean for our society and our future? Only time will tell.
